# fastish Documentation

Welcome to fastish - your AWS infrastructure automation service that helps you build cool stuff without the complexity.

## Overview: Infrastructure as Code with AWS CDK

In today's cloud landscape, teams spend more time wrestling with infrastructure complexity than building the features their customers need. We've developed a systematic approach to eliminate this friction - because the most valuable code is the code you never have to write.

Our AWS infrastructure automation service applies this principle alongside established engineering wisdom to dramatically accelerate your path from idea to production. By encoding infrastructure decisions into clear patterns using **AWS CDK** and **CloudFormation**, we help teams focus on what matters: delivering product value to their users.

fastish leverages the power of [AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit)](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) to define cloud infrastructure using familiar programming languages. This approach, known as [Infrastructure as Code (IaC)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/introduction-devops-aws/infrastructure-as-code.html), enables teams to version control their infrastructure, apply software engineering best practices, and automate deployments with confidence. By combining AWS CDK with battle-tested design patterns from the [AWS Well-Architected Framework](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/), we deliver infrastructure that is secure, reliable, performant, and cost-optimized from day one.

## What We Provide: AWS CDK Constructs for Modern Cloud Architecture

We build on AWS's proven blueprints to create comprehensive system architectures that scale. Our infrastructure is composed of modular, reusable **CDK constructs** that encapsulate cloud infrastructure best practices, allowing you to deploy production-ready environments in minutes rather than weeks:

### Multi-tenant SaaS Infrastructure (Cognito + DynamoDB + API Gateway)
Production-ready foundation layer that powers marketplace-ready applications with complete tenant isolation at the data, network, and application layers. Our multi-tenancy model implements row-level security in **DynamoDB**, tenant-scoped **API Gateway** authentication with **Cognito**, and isolated resource allocation to ensure data privacy and compliance with regulatory requirements like [GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/) and [HIPAA](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html).

### Modern Frontend Stack (Next.js + AWS Amplify + CloudFront)
**[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)** on **[AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/)** provides a powerful React-based frontend framework with automatic code splitting, server-side rendering (SSR), and static site generation (SSG) capabilities. Combined with our intelligent API layer built on **[Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/)**, you get automatic request throttling, tenant isolation through custom authorizers, and seamless integration with backend services. **CloudFront CDN** ensures global low-latency content delivery.

### Real-time Analytics Platform (Apache Druid + Amazon EKS + Kafka)
**[Apache Druid](https://druid.apache.org/)** on **[Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/)** with **[Grafana Cloud](https://grafana.com/products/cloud/)** integration delivers sub-second OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) queries for data-intensive workloads. Druid excels at ingesting and analyzing high-volume time-series data streams from sources like **[Amazon MSK (Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka)](https://aws.amazon.com/msk/)** or **[Amazon Kinesis](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/)**. Our EKS cluster leverages **[Karpenter](https://karpenter.sh/)** for intelligent, cost-optimized node provisioning that automatically scales based on workload demands.

### Flexible Architecture
Build B2B SaaS platforms with complete tenant management, process IoT sensor data at massive scale with real-time dashboards, or create your own application performance monitoring (APM) service. Our modular architecture supports diverse use cases including:
- **Event-driven architectures** using streaming data pipelines
- **Microservices platforms** with service mesh integration
- **Data lake analytics** combining S3, Athena, and Druid
- **Machine learning workflows** with scalable inference endpoints

## Quick Start: CDK Bootstrap & Deployment

Getting started requires AWS credentials, Node.js 18+, and AWS CDK CLI configured locally.

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Install AWS CDK CLI globally
npm install -g aws-cdk

# Verify AWS credentials are configured
aws sts get-caller-identity

# Bootstrap AWS CDK (one-time per account/region)
cdk bootstrap aws://YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/us-west-2
```

### Deploy Bootstrap Stack

The bootstrap stack creates foundational IAM roles, S3 buckets, and KMS keys required for all Fastish deployments:

```bash
# Clone the bootstrap repository
git clone git@github.com:fast-ish/bootstrap.git
cd bootstrap

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build TypeScript project
npm run build

# Configure synthesizer name
cat <<EOF > cdk.context.json
{
  "synthesizer": {
    "name": "prod"
  }
}
EOF

# Preview CloudFormation template
npx cdk synth

# Deploy bootstrap stack (creates fastish-prod)
npx cdk deploy
```

**What gets deployed:**
- Main stack: `fastish-prod`
- 8 IAM roles (handshake, lookup, assets, images, deploy, exec, druidExec, webappExec)
- S3 bucket for CDK assets
- ECR repository for container images
- KMS key with alias `alias/fastish`
- SSM parameter for version tracking

**Deployment time:** ~5-10 minutes
