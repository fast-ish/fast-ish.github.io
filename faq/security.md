# Security FAQ

## How does Fastish ensure infrastructure security?

We implement a comprehensive security-first approach:

- **Least Privilege Access**: All IAM roles follow the principle of least privilege
- **Encryption**: Data encrypted at rest and in transit using AWS KMS
- **Network Isolation**: VPC isolation with private subnets for sensitive resources
- **Audit Trails**: CloudTrail logging for all API activities
- **Secrets Management**: AWS Secrets Manager for credential storage

## What compliance standards does Fastish support?

Our infrastructure patterns align with:
- AWS Well-Architected Framework security pillar
- SOC 2 Type II requirements
- GDPR data protection principles
- HIPAA technical safeguards (with appropriate configuration)

## How is multi-tenancy security handled?

We implement multiple layers of tenant isolation:

1. **Data Layer**: Row-level security in databases
2. **API Layer**: Tenant-scoped API keys and rate limiting
3. **Network Layer**: VPC and security group isolation
4. **Application Layer**: Runtime tenant context validation

## What about vulnerability management?

- **Automated Scanning**: Regular security scans of infrastructure
- **Dependency Updates**: Automated dependency vulnerability checks
- **Patch Management**: Systems Manager for automated patching
- **Security Groups**: Restrictive inbound rules by default

## How are secrets and credentials managed?

```yaml
Secret Storage:
  - AWS Secrets Manager for application secrets
  - KMS for encryption keys
  - Parameter Store for configuration
  - IAM roles for service authentication

Access Control:
  - Role-based access control (RBAC)
  - Temporary credentials via STS
  - No hardcoded secrets in code
  - Automated secret rotation
```

## What security monitoring is in place?

**Real-time Monitoring**:
- CloudWatch alarms for suspicious activities
- GuardDuty for threat detection
- Config rules for compliance monitoring
- VPC Flow Logs for network analysis

**Incident Response**:
- Automated remediation for common issues
- SNS notifications for security events
- CloudTrail lake for forensic analysis
- Backup and recovery procedures

## How do you handle data privacy?

- **Data Residency**: Choose your AWS region for data sovereignty
- **Data Classification**: Tag-based data classification
- **Access Logging**: All data access is logged
- **Data Deletion**: Automated data lifecycle policies
- **GDPR Compliance**: Right to erasure support

## What about DDoS protection?

Built-in protection includes:
- AWS Shield Standard (automatic)
- CloudFront for edge protection
- API Gateway throttling
- WAF rules for application protection
- Auto-scaling to absorb traffic spikes

## Security Best Practices

1. **Enable MFA**: Require multi-factor authentication
2. **Regular Audits**: Perform security assessments
3. **Incident Planning**: Have an incident response plan
4. **Training**: Security awareness for your team
5. **Updates**: Keep infrastructure components updated
